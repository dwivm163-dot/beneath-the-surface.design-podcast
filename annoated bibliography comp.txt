In this text, Costanza-Chock provides a structure for extending  creative agency to groups disproportionately affected by inequality, integrating guidelines, practical case studies, and bottom-up approaches. From a theoretical perspective, it can be useful in my research in terms of expanding on the hidden, collateral implications of design choices, such as who gains, who loses, and the ways  infrastructures   might be reshaped outside of just the final product.  Published by a respected academic press and widely cited across design studies, making it a highly credible and reliable scholarly source.

The NBC article by Zoe Milan outlines the overall mission and progress of the 15% pledge,
founded by Aurora James. The pledge calls on major corporations and retailers to allocate fifteen 
percent of their workplace and shelf space to black owned businesses and entrepreneurs. The article 
emphasizes the tangible impact on black business owners the pledge has made. Giving opportunities by 
having large retail spaces such as Sephora, Nordstrom, and Macy’s, increasing visibility, customers, and 
revenue. Milan also explains how James' decision of 15% was based on the population consensus in the 
United States, and having consumers participate by shopping at pledge partners and intentionally supporting
Black-owned brands. The article does a proper job of understanding James’ mission and how structural
change can create a tangible impact in Black communities.

Okwodu, Janelle. “Aurora James on Fashion, Feminism, and the Fifteen Percent Pledge.” Vogue, 26 Aug. 2020, www.vogue.com/article/aurora-james-september-issue-2020-15-percent-pledge
 
Aurora James founded Brother Vellies a black owned and female led lifestyle and accessories brand redefining luxury with a mission to uplift traditional artisans and sustainable practices. This is not something that we see often within the luxury space and already raises accessibility immensely to lots of people. Community is essential to her brand and identity which only pushes her designs further as outreach to groups that would not traditionally be in the space. During Covid she launched an initiative called the fifteen percent pledge which would incentivise retailers to display and sell more products from black designers at their stores. Her work, especially the fifteen percent movement, is about authenticity and human connection.

This article is a reflection upon the 3rd anniversary of the 15 percent pledge a look back from Aurora James provides a look into the progress of the movement. An important quote that I found is “So far, the Pledge’s impact can be seen in the impressive numbers. More than 625 Black-owned businesses have developed business relationships with companies that have taken the Pledge. The Pledge’s work, along with its partners, has created the potential to shift over $14 billion to Black entrepreneurs and businesses.” The Fifteen Percent Pledge is a racial and economic justice nonprofit organization urging major retailers and corporations to commit 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned businesses, fifteen percent is such a small percentage when you think about it especially when you think about the amount of volume moved by major retailers 15% should be the minimum. To date, 29 companies across three countries have committed to multi-year, contractual agreements, some as long as 10 years which is a truly large amount and would mean millions of dollars in sales.

Something interesting that this article highlights that is incredibly important to our research is Aurora James consistent use of artisans within Africa, she does not rely on them for just one component but rather the whole shoe giving them further agency to go on and produce on their own. She makes a direct effort to not only build community with her artisans but provide real things they might need like a rain water purifier. James has been praised for empowering these artisans but it is not easy work and she acknowledges that some of these villages are inaccessible or dangerous, regardless she still makes an avid effort to work hard for the artisans she uses pushing her designs further allowing many to benefit from her success. She makes an avid effort to reject and go against norms set by the industry and wants to be pro employees which is shocking as we see so many major fashion houses using unethical labor.

James argues for DEI speaking about it as a strength not as just an initiative but as a way to have diverse perspectives which could open doors that previously wouldn't be known. Her consistent effort to empower black designers within her own company and out her mission is clear and deeply ingrained in her work and life. She is someone who holds companies accountable for rolling back DEI programs and not respecting their workers, so many companies do not practice what they preach and seeing an artist and designer with a real platform go against that is incredibly important and pushes their work further.
