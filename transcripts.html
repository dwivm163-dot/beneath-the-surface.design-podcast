welcome back to our design studies Podcast. Today. We're diving into our semester project on designer Aurora James, her impact, her philosophy and why she matters in conversations about fashion activism and representation, we're sophomores at Parsons. My name is Peter Sanford, and I'm joined

                            
Speaker 2  0:23  
Hi. I'm Mannatt duyveli. I am Aria. Let's go Hi. I'm Enika.

                            
Speaker 1  0:29  
So when we first started this project, we originally planned to interview Aurora herself, but instead, we got to speak to a professor of ours who has followed aurora's career for over a decade and has worked in a similar industry space. Honestly, this gave us even more perspective, and today we're going to be breaking down what we learned and how this changed our understanding of design. So to preface with some context, we're going to first start by breaking down who Aurora James is, why she was relevant, and why we are interested in what she's doing. Perfect.

                            
Speaker 3  1:02  
Hurt. So aura James is actually the founder of brother bellies, and she's also the creator of the 15% pledge and more. So she's known for the way that she blends fashion design with social activism. So her work highlights sort of more like Artisan like African halfmanship from across that continent, but also pushing for actual structural change in the retail and fashion industries. So she's like, built this brand that it's not just creative, but like, driven by her values, like environmentally and culturally, which actually makes her stand out in the space where activism and esthetics rarely come together just so naturally. And yeah, so to me, I sort of brought her up and chose her for the project, because, to me, she represents a form of leadership. So it sort of feels personal, intentional, like, like, culturally aware, you know? And at first I feel like, when I suggest doing mainly salaries a designer with, like, more like, a strong social message. But after, like, researching more deeply, her design process really does come first, and we'll get into that a little bit later. And yeah, essentially she's leading with design while, like, her own mission or value sort of the cherry on top. So I was thinking like, what were y'all thinking when I was suggesting choosing Aurora? Like, how's your perfect for me

                            
Speaker 4  2:21  
personally, like, when you first suggested her, I really didn't know who she was, until I, like, looked her up, and the first thing I saw was her dressing AOC at the Met Gala and the tax the rich dress, and it all just kind of like put everything into perspective. And then after that, I was just like, researching her, and then I learned more about like, her 15% pledge, for like, those who don't know, basically, she urges companies like Sephora and Macy's in these major retailer spaces to allocate 15% of their shelf space to black entrepreneurs. So yeah, I actually had a chance to talk with one of my professors. What professor would do here at Parsons, and she was actually able to give me, like, really great insight about Aurora, because she had actually worked with her back in, I believe, like, 2017 it was for when she was working with Kate Spade. And so during our interview, she was, yeah, talking about how she's followed her since, like, 2013 and how she's, like, been a really big inspiration to the work she does, because Professor Wadud also is really focused on, like, ethics and sustainability within the fashion space. And so, you know, hearing my professor, who I had no idea, had this connection to, you know, Aurora James, like, it was really interesting to hear that, but yeah, she basically described, like, bringing aura into, like, the Kate space team years ago, and how, like, generous she was with her time. She also made it a point to talk about colorism, and this was like a big topic during our interview. Basically, she said that James was aware that she was a fair skinned black woman, and because of that, and like her look, it gives her access to more opportunities and things like that. And I don't know, at least in my culture, I can kind of understand that and relate to it. I don't know if anyone else in this group can Yeah, or feels that way.

                            
Unknown Speaker  4:27  
Yeah. I mean, definitely, I think you

                            
Speaker 2  4:32  
see this a lot, maybe not as much in the West, because in the West, it's very divided into either you're a person of color or you're not, and people often don't realize that it's not as simple as that, but just within that community, within that space, there's so much division about whether you're dark skin or light skin, and that can make so much of a difference in how you're treated, and you see it so much in. Asian culture, where, yeah, absolutely, yeah, where you know, even if within your own country, your own culture, your own people, you're treated differently. But whether you're light skinned or dark skin,

                            
Speaker 4  5:15  
right, it's like this really big like internalized racism, and I think her touching on that, like in every conversation that she gives, or any panel that she gives, is a very like, it's a very important feature to be highlighted because it's so like, underrated. I feel it's a very niche type of experience. You know,

                            
Speaker 2  5:37  
definitely not something that is as talked about, and I think, something that if most people, if you haven't experienced it firsthand, don't even realize

                            
Unknown Speaker  5:48  
or Yeah,

                            
Speaker 4  5:50  
but like, even after talking that she was talking about, like, because of her opportunities and stuff, she's Been wanting to give more visibility, again, more to black entrepreneurs here in America. And so she was, and Wajid was also talking about her personal experiences with it, and how oftentimes it's really hard for people of color to be in places of power and like, use their voices because they are one of one. And like, you know, gaining this opportunity itself is already such a big deal, but it's important to remember that you have one foot in the door which others, like have never, like even thought of. So it's kind of like their response. It's, you know, that responsibility does fall, yeah.

                            
Speaker 2  6:38  
And I think it also brings up a really interesting conversation about how the industry takes information or perceives information, depending on who's delivering it. And because, you know, I think this really the interview really highlighted how it's not just about whether an initiative or a product is good, but about whether the industry decision makers are willing to hear it from a particular person.

                            
Speaker 4  7:12  
Yeah, exactly. And so that leads us into like the next portion of like these strategies that she was made, like these decisions she was making along the way of placing herself in these really high visible like areas such as like reality TV or, you know, other online appearances. So people are learning from her experience and her intentions behind all of this, and just raising awareness of like fashion and activism as a whole.

                            
Speaker 1  7:42  
To add on to that, I think something that like is highlighted in her in her strategic design making, is that not only when she's leading her brand, is she leading with design, but she's also leading with this lens of activism, which I think gives her a bit of a leg up that a lot of people miss is because she's seen as this kind of, almost, I want to say reliable. I don't know if that's the right word, but like, as like, reliable, yeah. Like, she's a trustworthy. People believe that she has good intentions and like, I think, I think that gives her a lot of of bandwidth and and people will probably give her more, you know, I mean, she's kind of collaborated with anybody, just to name a few, a few brands, Sephora Marvel dove all these really big industry names, and she's done really big collaborations with them, which are really hard to get. And I think she's given that by the fact that she kind of exudes her brand and her message in every aspect, which is really smart, which is it's really great, it's a really great engine. I think it works really well for her.

                            
Speaker 4  8:53  
I mean, yeah, going off of that, like, do you think activism, like, strengthens or complicates a designer's career?

                            
Speaker 1  9:00  
I mean, I think, and we touched on this in our lecture a little bit 100% because you really do have to live that, like when we when she's talking about things like the 15% Initiative, or just anything she's talking about, you know, working with artisans directly, or making sure that everything is done totally ethically. You really have to stand by that. And sometimes it's out of your hands if you're collaborating with somebody and they don't have the same practices as you. The oldest is the boy. So I do think she kind of puts herself in the sights of a lot of criticism. But the flip side of that coin is, I do think she does a lot of good like I think it's a really courageous thing she's doing to have this thing that is kind of like her image, her, label her everything. So I think it's a very like courageous position to take, but it is like a very risky position to take. And that's why I feel like you don't see a lot of designers like Aurora James that are. Kind of, like, really living this mission and, like letting it be so baked into their image.

                            
Speaker 4  10:06  
Yeah, absolutely, like, for sure, like, I think again, like we talked about, like, Aurora acknowledges her place of privilege. And a lot of designers who, you know, maybe are darker skin tones, are part of, like that queer community, they're not given the same platform as she is, or, you know, like another type of designer, and so speaking out could be something that's incredibly risky and hurt them even more in the future, rather than build them up.

                            
Speaker 3  10:37  
And that's true, but to me, I felt like she was really smart, because she analyzed that risk, like she knew what she was getting into. And to me, it almost felt like it's just honorable because she knew what she was getting into, but she still, no matter what, speaks up for the communities and like, uplifts other African communities. And to me, I communities, and to me, like, even though it's very risky and can cause a lot of conflict, yeah, what? What's more important is that you're empowering these people. It's absolutely that you're going into an untapped market, basically, and having so much support from people who aren't really like feeling supported. Otherwise, it's so important, because you don't really see that these days, even then it's like, it's like, just so much impact. But then at the same time, you don't, it's not like you see like 10 billion news articles about her, but she still has this immense impact. That just proves how, like, not a lot of people are even willing to like report about this, even though she is like, the reason why Sephora actually carries like, whole black, black owned brand category, right? Like she hasn't someone's impact, but it just comes out systematically. It's like we're still struggling and, like, the design world of like, really giving that visibility to, like, African American communities and other marginalized

                            
Speaker 2  12:14  
adding, just adding on to that point. I think another important aspect is, like, talking about how she, you know, her role also as, like an activist, activist, I think with a lot of initiatives like this, you see change trying to be implemented, not at in systematic level, but More so in terms of raising awareness and an outward change, but you don't end up often seeing the actual result of that in the system. But what Aurora has done differently is that she's not only designing these products or initiatives, but also designing visibility structures who is seen on the shelves, and financial structures like who gets the buying power from retailers and how social impact is communicated to consumers without being, you know, framed as like a charity, right?

                            
Speaker 4  13:21  
I think another company or another designer that also does a really good job of this is Evie Parker. They're known, I don't know if y'all know that brand, but they're known for like their cannabis products, but they make them look like, very like high fashion, and basically, a good amount of their proceeds go to helping incarcerated people who've been like, put in prison wrongfully for like, small amounts of marijuana. And so it kind of goes again, like people are able to use their businesses for good and actually make a difference.

                            
Speaker 1  13:56  
Wait, would you say the name of the brand was Edie Parker,

                            
Speaker 4  14:00  
Ed, like, E, D, I, E, and

                            
Speaker 1  14:07  
then wait to add on to what you guys have been saying, I think another, like, really admirable thing about her is, on top of all of these, like, firm positions she's taking and All the activism she's doing, she's also able to capitalize on that moment, like, for an example, like styling AOC at the Met Gala, like that's a moment where she can get her message across, and then it's a major kind of, like, cultural talking point. It's a lot of publicity for her. So I think it's, like, really admirable that not only can she advance herself as an activist, but she can also use it to get herself forward as a designer, and I do think that's a balance. And like, can, will she be able to always maintain that and like, let them be fully balanced? I don't know, but I do think it is really like, it's really cool that she. She's been able to use her message not only to help others, but also propel herself as a designer, to be in to have an even bigger platform.

                            
Speaker 4  15:09  
Like, yeah, I agree, like that, like you were saying the AOC dress at the Met Gala that caused such a big conversation. I remember when that look like first dropped. I mean, being from Texas, people were not a fan of that look. And I think it just also comes with like people were so upset of it because of like the lack of understanding. And that's, again, what Aurora James does so well. It forces you to look at like these questions and like these situations and really go into these topics and do your own research and figure out what's going on. Because when was this like, 2017 I think, right, when that look,

                            
Unknown Speaker  15:51  
let me look it up.

                            
Speaker 4  15:54  
But whenever it like, Yeah, whenever it did happen, like, I wasn't really sure what was going on, but it was through her design, I was then able, you know, 2020,

                            
Unknown Speaker  16:05  
yeah, okay, yeah, wow, yeah.

                            
Speaker 1  16:08  
But I remember the same thing, like there was a lot of outrage, yeah, I feel like, I mean, there was just a lot of talk good and bad and, I mean, that is everything. But, yet, being able to have something like address caused that much controversy. Is like, I don't know, not many, not many people, not many designers. Now, I feel like can do that, especially in the current media climate. I feel like most things we're looking at from the Met Gautam is like, oh, like, Jaden Smith is wearing a house or something, you know what? I mean, yeah, like, moments be able to be captured. Like, I don't know. Not every designer can do that.

                            
Speaker 4  16:50  
Why do we think, like, designers now are so scared about speaking out because, like, I feel like that's, like the whole point of art, it kind of, you know, it kind of goes against the whole reasoning behind it, like, there shouldn't, you know, I

                            
Speaker 1  17:05  
just feel like there's so many options. It's like, why would I like for a lot of these companies, they're trying to play it so safe. And it's like, why would I risk, you know, the mainstream, whatever that's gonna like your message.

                            
Speaker 2  17:18  
Well, I think what also, we don't realize is, the thing is, the most of the designers that most people know, the big names, the big brands, they are the companies and the people that are benefiting from these systems. So they're not the ones that are going to speak out against them. The ones that do speak out against them are your smaller, lesser known brands and artists that don't end up getting as much coverage in the media and you don't end up hearing as much about it, which is why I think this was one of those moments where the stress blew up so much because this is one of those few designers that is in a really big position of power and was able to bring something like this to something like the Met Gala. I mean, it's the frickin Met Gala like there is no better platform more that will like spread your message, right? So also, just thinking about that, a lot of it just has to do with not, why aren't people speaking out about this, but also, why aren't we giving a stage to the people who are speaking about it,

                            
Speaker 4  18:39  
exactly like, I guess going off of that, like, how is like we as students, you know, we're not maybe able to support Aurora James, like, by buying one of her pieces, but I guess, how are we, and the people listening at home, able to then, you Know, go and support these type of,


Unknown Speaker  19:01  
you know causes,

                            
Speaker 1  19:06  
I feel like a really great way for us, especially given that we are so privileged to have the education that we have here, is to go out into the world and kind of like continue the work of The artists like Roy James that we admire, that we see, use their platform to get their message across, I feel like we have a unique position where we can also do the same thing, whether now we can't really scale, but we can do it at a smaller, intimate scale,

                            
Speaker 2  19:38  
yeah, and Just adding on to that, I think, for not just us as students, but anyone you know, we now have people like Aurora James who are giving or creating these opportunities and platforms for people to support black owned businesses. You know, they're off. They're making sure. That they are present in these big in Sephora and Macy's accessible to us. So then that, you know, leaves us to do our part, to actually go out. It's being made conveniently accessible to us. So then it's our responsibility to try and support those businesses and try and shop from those businesses.

                            
Speaker 3  20:20  
It's our part as the Yeah, I agree. It's our part as the consumer to actually keep maintain it, like, keep it going. Because, I don't know if y'all know this story, but there's a black, owned brand in Sephora, like, I mean, Clay, well, there was, because, unfortunately, she, she was just played in sephora's Like, she her brand was just laid there and, like, the sort of, like, I remember,

                            
Unknown Speaker  20:44  
right, wait, what brand was this?

                            
Speaker 3  20:48  
Ami colay, so it's a black, owned brand, and she was small, like, but she was still just played in Sephora. And, like, the more smaller, like, end caps. But the problem was, is that she just was not receiving enough support by consumers, and she had a cult following, like she had, like she had, like a pretty loyal fan base, but she just couldn't, like the brand was not having enough outreach, and that, in part, is to playing with Sephora for just putting, sort of, like hiding her a little bit, but Also the, mainly the consumer, for just not really participating, because at the end of the day, the sales is what is going to keep a company going? If a company cannot keep going that, then it's we. They lose that part of their voice, and that sucks. Yeah, small, a small, black, owned brand that just did not receive enough support. And it's, it sucks, and that's why it's important. Like, I agree. Like, it's just so important for the consumer to actually partake in it. Because you can, we can talk all day about, like, oh, people aren't getting enough recognition, but it's on us to recognize, yeah, 100% also.

                            
Speaker 4  22:02  
Like, now, like Peter was saying and like how you're saying, like, it is our job as consumers, and especially, you know, going to school that we go to, this is such a topic of conversation, whether it's, you know, how to ethically run a business, or how to, you know, sustainably run a business. These are questions we're always, constantly asking ourselves, and you know, it gives, I don't know about y'all, but it gives me, like, some sort of, like comfort knowing that, okay, like, maybe, like, the older generations weren't so thoughtful about these situations, but now we're able to implement strategies that are as benefit benefits, Like maturity.

                            
Speaker 1  22:40  
Would you all say? Yeah, I think, I think to add on to that. I do really agree with that, and add on to what we were saying earlier about that, that little antidote, I feel like it's really important to vote with your dollar, like we really choose what brands are popular, what brands are supported. We really get to choose what we see in stores. And I think that we all just need to, like, really remember that we we choose what to support, and that the dollar really is, like our greatest power is, like, who we give our money to.

                            
Speaker 4  23:14  
Yeah, absolutely. And also just in terms of, like, giving visibility, because, for instance, like when Ari was talking about this brand, like, I remember glossier was also like a really big cult following, and they didn't really have a big, I don't know, display at Sephora, at first, it was like kind of small. But again, it was through like, brand visibility that they were able to grow. And that's and that's partially on us, that is on us as consumers, to help with that. I think

                            
Speaker 2  23:45  
after our interview with the professor, this conversation really changed how I looked at the research. I think the our initial question kind of focused more on the downstream effects of a product after it's made, right? What? How it affects society when it comes into use, but after the interview, I think I want to it becomes more about how a designer has actually constructed the social and visual and institutional frameworks that allow their work to produce an impact at all, and I think that requires us to look more into designer identity and positionality, and how that affects access to platforms and how stories about ethical production are communicated, and who is allowed the authorship?

                            
Speaker 4  24:57  
Yeah, absolutely. It forces us to look. At what's going on before these things come out, until it's too late to realize, if that makes any sense, it's making us look again, like at these systems in play, and how, you know, we're able to step in, not only as a consumer, but as a designer standpoint as well. To you know, right the wrongs.

                            
Speaker 1  25:25  
I think something I really learned and like something I kind of want to take forward into my own design practice is like not having to sacrifice your own message, upbringing, past emotion, not having to sacrifice any of that to further your own intentions with into the design world, and actually using all of those things to kind of uplift yourself and using them as tools.

                            
Speaker 2  25:55  
I think it Aurora James is just it's been the perfect example of showing how, you know she has this influence and power because she understands how design identity and systematic change intersect, yeah,

                            
Speaker 3  26:12  
and for me, like, I sort of took that away to where I was thinking, like, because to me, it's important to uplift my like my trans sisters, like my trans community. And I feel like, after looking through what, like, what she's done for like the black like black Americans and like African communities, it's like I can really take that into my own practice, because in my career, I really do want to uplift my my community as well. And I feel like, no matter looking at her, I'm like, wow. Like, she's great. Like, no matter the risk, I'm like, you just have to go for it.

                            
Speaker 4  26:46  
Yeah, absolutely. Like, Aurora James shows us that these things are a possibility, and it's important to keep these things in mind as you're building the business, because at the end of the day, it's it is about like your consumers and how they're treated. It's not always just about simply getting a cash grab, just because, you know, we can do that. We can get away with that. In this type of industry, it's important to always come back and remember exactly why we're designing and the purpose of what we're designing for, right?

                            
Speaker 2  27:19  
That's so important because design is a form of power it, and it's designers like Aurora who use that power to challenge existing systems and reshape who gets to be visible. And that should be, that should be an example that all of us follow.
